# Irrigation Controller

This project provides a simple, secure irrigation control system based on a
Raspberry Pi and an MCP23017 I¬≤C GPIO expander.

It consists of three main components:

1. **irrigationd** ‚Äì the daemon (background service) that listens for commands
   over TCP and controls irrigation zones via the MCP23017.
2. **irrigationctl** ‚Äì a lightweight CLI tool to send commands to the daemon.
3. **Home Assistant integration** ‚Äì Python code that allows zones to be managed
   from Home Assistant as switches.

## üîß Build and Install

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

This installs:

- `/usr/local/bin/irrigationd` ‚Äì the daemon
- `/usr/local/bin/irrigationctl` ‚Äì the CLI tool
- `/etc/systemd/system/irrigationd.service` ‚Äì systemd unit
- `/etc/default/irrigationd` ‚Äì configuration file (token and bind address)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `/etc/default/irrigationd`:

```bash
IRRIGATIOND_TOKEN=changeme-very-secret-token
IRRIGATIOND_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1
```

- **IRRIGATIOND_TOKEN** ‚Äì required token for all commands.
- **IRRIGATIOND_BIND_ADDR** ‚Äì set to `127.0.0.1` (default) to only accept local
  connections, or `0.0.0.0` to allow remote access.

Reload systemd and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable irrigationd
sudo systemctl start irrigationd
```

Check logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u irrigationd -f
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### CLI Tool

Turn on zone 1 for 30 seconds:

```bash
irrigationctl "ZONE=1 TIME=30 TOKEN=changeme-very-secret-token"
```

Turn off zone 1:

```bash
irrigationctl "ZONE=1 TIME=0 TOKEN=changeme-very-secret-token"
```

### Netcat (debugging)

```bash
echo "ZONE=1 TIME=10 TOKEN=changeme-very-secret-token" | nc 127.0.0.1 4242
```

---

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

A custom integration is provided under `custom_components/irrigation/`. Copy
this directory into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.

Update your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: irrigation
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 4242
    token: changeme-very-secret-token
    zones:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
```

Restart Home Assistant. Each zone will appear as a switch.

---

## üîí Security Notes

- Always configure a strong `IRRIGATIOND_TOKEN`.
- Keep `IRRIGATIOND_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1` unless you explicitly need remote access.
- Use a firewall if exposing the service beyond localhost.
- Home Assistant integration must be configured with the same token.
